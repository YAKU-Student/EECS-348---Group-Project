# Final Project - EECS348  

This is the repository for our final project for EECS-348 (Software Engineering I) at KU

## Project Objective  

> This project delves into the world of digital logic. You will develop a C++ program acting as a    
> simplified Boolean logic simulator. The aim of this project is to develop a program that    
> simulates the behavior of logic circuits, including operations such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and    
> XOR. The program should be able to handle complex logic circuits with multiple gates and   
> input/output signals. The project will provide students with comprehensive hands-on experience   
> in software engineering, emphasizing the development process from project planning to fully   
> realized product. While aiming for the functionality of a full-fledged circuit simulator, we'll focus   
> on evaluating Boolean expressions for an introductory learning experience.   
> 
> This project provides an opportunity to explore the fascinating concepts of logic gates, truth   
> tables, and expression evaluation. You'll gain valuable skills in parsing, data structures,   
> algorithm design, and software engineering principles.
